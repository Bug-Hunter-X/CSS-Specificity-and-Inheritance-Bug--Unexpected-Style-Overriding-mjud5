The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance.  The `.container` class styles are unexpectedly overridden by the `h1` element styles, even though `.container` has higher specificity.

```css
.container {
  color: blue;
}

h1 {
  color: red;
}

.container h1 {
  color: green; /* This rule is intended to override both, but doesn't fully */
}
```

In this example, we expect the `<h1>` element inside `.container` to be green. However, sometimes the `<h1>` elementâ€™s `color: red` style might unexpectedly take precedence.
